At first, I wanted to become a teacher. I have always loved explaining and see the spark in someone's eyes when understanding something. I even did two years of University but during  my second year I discovered coding. Since then, I have never stopped. It caught me and never let go, I needed it to be my job. Then, what I had to do was obvious. I integrated CY-Tech leading French Engineering School awarding a Master of Science in Computer Science Engineering and I am now in my second to last year in that school. Plus, I can still help others both in real life and online, helping my colleagues at school and being an active member of Stack Overflow. Activities that greatly help in developing my socials skills.

The world of Computer Science is vast and full of fascinating subjects. The deeper you go, the more satisfying it gets. Eager to learn, I dove into several computer science fields. From simple programs in Python and C to applications with graphical interfaces and websites. I have joined Game Jams, making games from scratch in 48h to 72h with constraint. Going through an artificial intelligence tutorial to code a machine learning program recognizing numbers from pictures. I have also discovered cyber-security through TryHackMe a site giving the means to learn and practice pentesting which is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of a system. Every day, as I learn more, I see what I don’t know expanding and that drives me to keep going and improving myself.

I could keep talking hours on end on subjects I know, but what I don’t know interests me the most. Don’t hesitate to contact me for an interesting conversation!
